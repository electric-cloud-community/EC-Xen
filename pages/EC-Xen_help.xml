    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source
    enterprise-ready server virtualization and cloud computing
    platform, delivering the Xen Hypervisor with support for a
    range of guest operating systems including Windows and Linux
    network and storage support, management tools in a single,
    tested installable image, which is also called XCP
    appliance.</p>

    <p>XCP addresses the needs of cloud providers, hosting services
    and data centers by combining the isolation and multi-tenancy
    capabilities of the Xen hypervisor with enhanced security,
    storage and network virtualization technologies to offer a rich
    set of virtual infrastructure cloud services. The platform also
    address user requirements for security, availability,
    performance and isolation across both private and public
    clouds.</p>

    <p>XCP consolidates server workloads, enables savings in power,
    cooling, and management costs and thus contributing to
    environmentally sustainable computing, an increased ability to
    adapt to ever-changing IT environments, an optimized use of
    existing hardware, and an improved level of IT reliability.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to Xen Cloud Platform</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>The plugin communicates with XCP through Xen application
    programming interface (XAPI or XenAPI) which provides support
    for developers to manage VMs, storage, networking, host
    configuration and pools. API calls make use of the XML-RPC
    protocol to transmit requests and responses over the network.
    EC-vCloudDirector plugin provides a more generic interface for
    managing resources.</p>

    <p>The XML-RPC API server executing on the host accepts secure
    socket connections. This allows a client to execute the APIs
    over the https protocol. This provides secure and authenticated
    access to the Xen Cloud Platform installation.</p>

    <p>The plugin interact with XenAPI using PERL to perform the
    following tasks:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create configuration to hold connection information.</li>

      <li>Query for virtual machines information.</li>

      <li>Perform actions on machines.</li>

      <li>Clone, Suspend, cleanup, and deploy VMs...</li>

      <li>Create ElectricFlow resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This plugin provides two primary actions: Provision and
    Cleanup, which work as a pair within a job.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against Xen Cloud
    Platform version 1.1.0</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow minimum version 3.6</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class="required">bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="CreateConfiguration"><a name="CreateConfiguration" id="CreateConfiguration"></a>

    <h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
    <!-- If the plugin has separate configurations then include this section,
otherwise omit this whole section. We don't need to have a configuration
section that just says "There is no configuration for this plugin."
-->

    <p>Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
    across some or all of the plugin's procedures. They are
    intended to reduce repetition of common values, create
    predefined sets of parameters for end users, and to securely
    store credentials where needed. Each configuration is given a
    unique name that is entered in designated parameters on
    procedures that use them.<br />
    <br />
    Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the EC-Xen plugin, there is a
    "Configure" link which will open the Configuration page.</p>
    <!-- For all parameters, the parameter name should be *exactly* the same as it appears in the
    Parameter Panel, and the first sentence(s) of the description should be
    the same as the tooltip (if there is one). After that, the parameter
    description can go into greater detail about the parameter including
    valid value ranges and examples.

    Template in the Server. The plugin will store properties on the
    ElectricFlow server at the location provided in "Results

    blank, resources will be assigned to "EC-$[JobStepId]" pool.
    The plugin will set properties on the ElectricFlow server
    using the values from "Results Location" and "Results Tag".
    Users can set the location where they want properties to be
    stored by specifying the "Results Location" field, if this
    field is blank, the default location in the job is used:
    /myJob/Xen/vms. When this procedure is executed, properties

    <h2>Use Case 1: Provision, Consume &amp; Cleanup Job</h2>

    <p>Provision and cleanup work as a pair within a job.</p>

    <p>The most common use for this plugin is to create a VM, then
    create an ElectricFlow resources assigned to the virtual
    machines, use the resource(s) to run some operations, and the
    delete the resource and the VM. To accomplish these tasks you
    must:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create a Plugin Configuration.</li>

      <li>Provision a Xen VM.</li>

      <li>Create a Resource(s) for this provision.</li>

      <li>Use the created resource(s).</li>

      <li>Delete the resource(s).</li>

      <li>Delete the provisioned VM.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Create a Plugin Configuration</h4>

    <p>Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the EC-Xen plugin, there is a
    "Configure" link which will open the Configuration page.<br />
    Create a new configuration by specifying the requested
    parameters:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/create_config.png" />

    <p>Once the configuration is created, you can see it listed in
    "Xen Configurations", and now you are able to provision a new
    VM.</p>

    <h4>Provision</h4>

    <p>Create a new Provision procedure, fill in the requested
    parameters with real values from your Xen Cloud Platform
    server:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/provision_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Consume</h4>

    <p>Create a new command step to use the created resource, in
    this example we will pick a resource from the pool and just add
    an ec-perl sleep to use it for 30 seconds</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/consume_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Cleanup</h4>

    <p>Now the resource has been used and is ready to be cleaned
    up, create a Cleanup step, fill in the requested
    parameters:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/cleanup_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Results and outputs</h4>

    <p>Once the job finished, you can see properties stored in
    "Results Location".<br />
